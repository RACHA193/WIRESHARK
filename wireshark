=> SCCP(skinny client control protocol)(port 2000 TCP) - used between the phone and the router.
=> ESP(encapsulating security protocol)(port 4500 UDP) - is a member of internet protocol(IP sec) set of protocols that encrypt and authenticate the packets of data 
       between computers using a virtual private network(VPN).
=> ARP(address resolution protocol) - is a layer 2 protocol used to map MAC address to IP address. All hosts on a network are located by their IP addresses,
       but NIC's do not have IP addresses, they have MAC addresses. ARP is the protocol used to associate the IP address to a MAC address. (no specific 
       port nummber as it operates at the data link layer at the OSI model).
       ARP packets are encapsulated within ethernet frames, which do have source and destination port numbers. The source port number is typically set to
       0x0000, and the destination port number is set to 0x0806, which identifies the frame as an ARP packet.
